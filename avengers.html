        <h1><u>.Avengers.</u></h1>
        <p><i>The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
                (MCU)
                media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in
                1963.
                Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States–based organization composed
                primarily of
                superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the
                world's
                protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York:
                originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently in the Avengers Compound in
                Upstate
                New
                York. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters originally consisting of Tony Stark / Iron Man,
                Steve
                Rogers / Captain America, Thor Odinson, Bruce Banner / Hulk, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Clint
                Barton /
                Hawkeye, it later expands to include 16 total members. Regarded as an important part of the franchise,
                they
                are
                central to the MCU's first 23 films, collectively known as the Infinity Saga. The Avengers from
                alternate
                universes were depicted in subsequent MCU properties across the Multiverse Saga, including appearances
                in
                the
                Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021–present) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
                (2022). A
                new
                incarnation of the Avengers are set to return in Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars
                (2027).
                Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.

                Following the formation of Marvel Studios as an independent film studio by Avi Arad, the head of
                Marvel's
                film
                division, producer Kevin Feige envisioned creating a shared cinematic universe to introduce the
                Avengers,
                similar to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic books in the 1960s. Once Feige became studio chief in 2007
                and
                formed
                his creative team, his strategy involved creating individual films for each major character in Phase
                One,
                beginning with Iron Man (2008) and concluding with The Avengers (2012). Casting for the original six
                members
                occurred from 2006 to 2010, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and concluding with Mark
                Ruffalo
                replacing Edward Norton as the Hulk by 2010. Successive MCU installments introduced new members, with
                actors
                from other MCU films reprising their roles. Following the financial and critical success of The
                Avengers, a
                sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was subsequently developed, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and
                Elizabeth
                Olsen joining as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, respectively. Then, Captain America: Civil War (2016) was
                gradually
                reworked into a film influenced by the "Civil War" comic storyline, depicting the Avengers's division
                and
                introducing Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers:
                Endgame
                (2019)
                concluded the Infinity Saga and depicted their disbandment.</i></p>

                    popular

        <p><i>In 2012, the Asgardian Loki teleports to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility on Earth, where he steals
                the
                Tesseract and brainwashes Clint Barton and Dr. Erik Selvig using his scepter. Subsequently, Fury
                recruits
                Stark
                and Banner to locate the Tesseract. Rogers, Romanoff, and Stark apprehend Loki, but are disrupted by
                Thor's
                arrival. This leads to confrontations between the group, exacerbated by the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D.
                is
                using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction. Barton attacks the Helicarrier, causing
                Banner to
                transform into the Hulk and cause damage. After Loki kills S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, the team
                unites
                to
                avenge him, with Romanoff freeing Barton from the scepter's control. Rogers then recruits Barton to the
                team
                as
                a new member. The Avengers confront Loki, who opens a wormhole using the Tesseract and begins an
                invasion
                with
                his Chitauri army, starting a battle.[8] Stark introduces the team to Loki by referring to them as
                "Earth's
                Mightiest Heroes".[9] Eventually, the World Security Council launches a nuclear missile towards
                Manhattan,
                but
                Stark intercepts and flies it through the wormhole, destroying the Chitauri mother ship and stopping the
                invasion. Romanoff closes the portal with the scepter and the team apprehends Loki, who is taken back to
                Asgard.</i>
